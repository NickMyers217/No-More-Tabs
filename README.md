# About
- This is a purely functional ES6 program I've written to replace tabbed indentation in code with arbitrary amounts of spaces. Its a work in progress right now and not really something I needed to make. But I felt like doing it just to test out some of the latest Javascript features.

# TODO

- Rig the program to take the file as a command line parameter
- Allow for batch processing of files
- Allow the program to save copies of files, or overwrite them. As opposed to having to pipe the output into other shell commands. This is a luxury feature for me.
